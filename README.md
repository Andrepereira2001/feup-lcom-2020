This repository contais the final project that I have done for the course unit LCOM while studing in FEUP

## GOLD MINER
This game consist in a car with a claw and is objective is to capture the maximum number of golds. This was possibel to do using the MINIX operating system. 
In order to achive the final result we needed to program all the periferics used (mouse, keyboard, timer, serial port and others)
